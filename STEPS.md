# Steps

1. Create new application by:
  - `mix new silesian_beamers_survey`

## TODO

- [ ] Starting nodes and connect them in a cluster (*commands*).
- [ ] Dumping answers to the file from the `Aggregator`.
- [ ] Explanation of `QuestionServer`:
  - [ ] No *OTP* / Processes / Distribution.
  - [ ] Just syntax, *pipe operator*, `Enum`, reading a file content.
